# python_C_examples
Some basic examples of python C extension modules.  Each example contains a `.c` file with C code, a same-named `.py` file that acts as a stand-in when the module is imported, and a jupyter notebook that demonstrates the usage of the compiled module.  The examples are:

- **ex0_getting_started**
    - Contains python script to find the C header files on your system
- **ex1**
    - First (and simplest) example of a C extension module: the module has one function that prints "Hello World!"
- **ex2**
    - Basic functions that accept and return basic variable types (i.e. ints, floats, strings)
- **ex3**
    - Functions that demonstrate how to work with python lists and tuples.
- **ex4**
    - Examples for how to work with NumPy arrays.
